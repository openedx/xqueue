"""
Framework for writing integration tests for xqueue and external
graders at the level of HTTP requests.
Basic xqueue communication:

1)    XQueueTestClient --(push)--> xqueue --(push/pull)--> GraderStub subclass

2)    GraderStub subclass --(push)--> xqueue --(push)--> GradeResponseListener

Test cases verify that the output to GradeResponseListener given
inputs specified by XQueueTestClient.


How messages get routed (PassiveGraderStub):

The test client sends messages to a particular queue.

XQueue checks its settings and finds that the queue has
a URL associated with it.  XQueue forwards the message to that URL.

PassiveGraderStub is listening at the URL and receives a POST request
from XQueue.  The stub responds synchronously with the graded response.

XQueue forwards grading responses to GradeResponseListener using
the callback_url provided by the test client.


How messages get routed (ActiveGraderStub):

The test client sends messages to a particular queue.
XQueue puts the messages in a RabbitMQ queue.

The ActiveGraderStub polls the XQueue using a REST-like interface.
When it receives a submission, it pushes a response back to XQueue
using the REST-like interface.

XQueue pushes the response back to the LMS.


Failure injection:

This framework also makes it easy to inject failure into the system:
for example, by configuring ExternalGraderStub to stop responding
to messages, or to send invalid responses.


RabbitMQ Requirement:

Integration tests currently require that rabbitmq is running.
You can start rabbitmq using the commands:

    rabbitmq-server
    rabbitmqctl start_app

See the installation guides at http://www.rabbitmq.com/download.html
for platform-specific instructions.


Jenkins:

XQueue's current design makes it difficult to test in a
continuous integration environment.
Here are some of the conflicts that can occur:

    1) Because workers run in separate threads and each access
        the database, we cannot use an in-memory database.
        File-based databases need unique names in order
        to avoid conflicts.

    2) Because workers pull messages from rabbitmq queues,
        the queue names need to be unique.  Otherwise,
        a test might pull a message created by another test.

The integration tests use open local ports and free the ports
for re-use when finished to avoid TCP port conflicts.
