# xqueue

XQueue defines an interface for the LMS to communicate with external
grader services.  For example, when a student submits a problem in the LMS,
it gets sent to the XQueue.  The XQueue then has the problem graded
by an external service and sends the response back to the LMS.

## How the LMS Interacts with the XQueue

1. The LMS pushes student submissions to the XQueue with an HTTP POST request to
the URL `/xqueue/submit`.  The submission contains a callback URL indicating
where the graded response should be sent.

2. When the submission has been graded, the XQueue pushes a response back
to the LMS with an HTTP POST request to the callback URL.

## How External Graders Interact with the XQueue

There are two ways kinds of grading services: passive and active.  These
interact with the XQueue in different ways.

### Passive Graders

Passive graders wait for the XQueue to send them submissions.  They then
respond synchronously with a graded response.

1. The LMS sends messages to a particular queue.

2. XQueue checks its settings and finds that the queue has a URL associated
with it.  XQueue forwards the message to that URL.

3. The passive grader receives a POST request from the XQueue and
responds synchronously with the graded response.

4. XQueue forwards the graded response to the callback URL the LMS
provided in its original message.

### Active Graders

Active graders pull messages off the XQueue and push responses back to the XQueue.

1. The test client sends messages to a particular queue.

2. The active grader polls the XQueue using a REST-like interface.  When it
receives a submission, it pushes a response back to the XQueue, also using
a REST-like interface.

3. XQueue pushes the response back to the LMS.

## Tests

You can run the unit/integration test suite using:

    rake test

from the base `xqueue` directory.

**Note:** If you do not have RabbitMQ installed and running, some tests
will produce errors.  See `test_framework/README.md` for more information.
